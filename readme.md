Profile Page

My profile page build that uses the Bootstrap framework as a basis to maintain consistent look and structure and is then further stylized using scss. Interactivity is added with HTML including a way to switch the theme colors for the website as well changing the contents of the skill info box which is updated based on which skill is moused over.
